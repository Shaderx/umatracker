# Year Pagination Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete year pagination system for the race planner modal that allows seamless transitions between Junior, Classic, and Senior years with animated visual feedback.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Year Transitions in Picker Modal**
- When navigating past the end of December 2nd half, the picker automatically transitions to the next year (Junior → Classic → Senior)
- When navigating before January 1st half, the picker automatically transitions to the previous year
- Prevents navigation beyond Junior start and Senior end

### 2. **Animated Pagination Dots**
- **Year Indicator Badge**: Shows current year with both English and Japanese labels
- **Color-Coded System**: Each year has its own pastel color:
  - **Junior**: Pastel mint green (`#B8E6D5`)
  - **Classic**: Pastel pink (`#FFD4E5`)
  - **Senior**: Pastel blue (`#D4E5FF`)
- **Smooth Animation**: When changing years, dots slide out and reset with a bouncy easing animation
  - Forward transition: Dots slide right, reset from left
  - Backward transition: Dots slide left, reset from right

### 3. **Synchronized Year Tabs**
- Main planner year tabs now match the pagination color scheme
- Active and hover states use the darker pastel shades
- Inactive states use lighter backgrounds for subtle contrast
- When year changes in picker, the main planner tabs update automatically

### 4. **Smart Context Awareness**
- The picker remembers which year it's viewing
- Race availability is filtered by the current picker year
- Selected races display correctly for each year's timeline

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

#### `js/features/picker-modal.js`
1. **`getAdjacentSlot()`** - Enhanced to handle year transitions:
   - Detects when navigation goes past year boundaries
   - Returns appropriate slot in next/previous year
   - Returns current slot when at absolute boundaries

2. **`navigatePicker()`** - Updated to detect year changes:
   - Compares previous and next year
   - Updates global `state.plannerYear` when year changes
   - Updates year tab visual states
   - Triggers year transition animation

3. **`renderPickerCarousel()`** - Now passes year information to card renderer

4. **`renderPickerCard()`** - Enhanced to use year-specific data:
   - Filters races by current picker year
   - Looks up planned races in correct year's data

5. **`updatePaginationDots()`** - Complete redesign:
   - Renders year indicator badge with color
   - Applies year-specific colors to active dot
   - Wraps dots in container for animation
   - Bilingual year labels (EN + JP)

6. **`animateYearTransition()`** - New function:
   - Applies directional animation classes
   - Auto-removes classes after animation completes

7. **`animateToSlot()`** - Updated to accept year parameter

#### `styles.css`
1. **Pagination Structure**:
   ```css
   .picker-pagination - Column layout for badge + dots
   .pagination-year-indicator - Year badge styling
   .pagination-dots-wrapper - Container for animated dots
   .pagination-dot - Individual dot styling with year colors
   ```

2. **Year Tab Styling**:
   - Removed generic green theme
   - Added year-specific color schemes with data attributes
   - Light pastel backgrounds for inactive state
   - Darker pastels for active/hover states
   - Responsive sizing maintained for mobile/tablet

3. **Animations**:
   ```css
   @keyframes slideDotsReset - Forward year transition
   @keyframes slideDotsResetBackward - Backward year transition
   ```
   - 600ms duration with bounce easing
   - Fade out at 50%, teleport, fade in
   - Applied via temporary classes

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
1. **Year Badge**: Always visible indicator of current year
2. **Color Consistency**: Same colors across tabs, badges, and active dots
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Animated dots give satisfying feedback
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Pastel colors are subtle and professional

### Interaction Flow
1. User navigates to end of year (December 2nd)
2. Swipes left or clicks right arrow
3. Pagination dots animate away and reset
4. Year badge updates to next year
5. Card content updates to show new year's January races
6. Main planner tabs automatically update

### Boundaries
- At Junior January 1st: Cannot go back further
- At Senior December 2nd: Cannot go forward further
- Visual feedback maintains current position at boundaries

## Color Palette

### Junior Year (Mint Green)
- **Inactive Background**: `#E8F5F0`
- **Active Background**: `#B8E6D5`
- **Active Hover Border**: `#8fd4bd`
- **Text (Inactive)**: `#2d5f4d`
- **Text (Active)**: `#1a4032`

### Classic Year (Pink)
- **Inactive Background**: `#FFF0F5`
- **Active Background**: `#FFD4E5`
- **Active Hover Border**: `#ffb3d1`
- **Text (Inactive)**: `#6b2d45`
- **Text (Active)**: `#4a1f31`

- **Text (Active)**: `#1a2f4a`

## Responsive Design
- Year indicator scales appropriately on mobile
- Dots remain visible and clickable on small screens
- Animation performance optimized with GPU acceleration
- Maintains accessibility with proper contrast ratios

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding year transition sound effects
- Could add celebration animation when completing a year
- Potential for year completion progress indicator
- Option to disable animations for accessibility

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Navigate from Junior to Classic transition
- [x] Navigate from Classic to Senior transition
- [x] Navigate backward from Senior to Classic
- [x] Navigate backward from Classic to Junior
- [x] Verify boundary stops at Junior start
- [x] Verify boundary stops at Senior end
- [x] Check year badge updates correctly
- [x] Verify dot colors match year
- [x] Test animation smoothness
- [x] Verify main tabs sync with picker year
- [x] Test on mobile/tablet viewports
- [x] Verify no linter errors

## Animation Synchronization

### Timing Details:
- **Duration**: 550ms (synchronized with card transition)
- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` (matches card swipe)
- **Trigger**: Starts immediately when navigation begins (runs in parallel)

### Pagination Dots Animation:
- Slides dots out 120% in the navigation direction
- Fades to opacity 0 at 45% mark
- Teleports to opposite side (-120%)
- Slides back in with fade up to opacity 1

### Year Badge Animation:
- Fades out and scales down to 0.8x (0-45%)
- Stays hidden (45-55%)
- Fades in and scales back to 1.0x (55-100%)
- Color changes mid-animation for new year

The pagination animation now runs perfectly synchronized with the card swipe transition, creating a cohesive visual experience.

## Notes
- Animation uses hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth 60fps
- Color choices are WCAG AA compliant for text contrast
- Bilingual labels maintain consistency with rest of UI
- Implementation is modular and easy to extend
- Pagination animation is pre-calculated and triggered before card movement starts
