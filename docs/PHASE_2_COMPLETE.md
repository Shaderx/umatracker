## 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 3 - UI Modules

### Immediate Priority (Medium Complexity)
1. **Extract `js/ui/progress-renderer.js`** (~150 lines)
   - Render hidden factor progress panel
   - Progress bars and statistics
   - Factor expansion/collapse

2. **Extract `js/ui/race-renderer.js`** (~200 lines)
   - Render race grid/cards
   - Race filtering and display
   - Race metadata rendering

3. **Extract `js/ui/planner-renderer.js`** (~250 lines)
   - Render race planner calendar
   - Month/year navigation
   - Cell highlighting and state

### Why UI Modules Next?
- **High Impact**: Most visible part of the app
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined rendering responsibilities
- **Testable**: Can verify output with browser tools
- **Enables Integration**: Once UI modules are done, we can wire everything together

## 🔍 Key Insights from Phase 2

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Clean Dependencies**: Check modules have minimal dependencies (mostly just `state`)
2. **Pure Functions**: Most check functions are pure (input → output, no side effects)
3. **Consistent Structure**: All checks return same result format (`{completed, current, required, progress, details}`)
4. **Easy Testing**: Functions work with empty state (0/X results)

### Challenges Overcome 💪
1. **Module Imports**: Successfully implemented cache-busting for dynamic imports
2. **State Management**: Properly imported and used shared state across modules
3. **Function Extraction**: Cleanly separated planner helpers from check logic
4. **Test Framework**: Enhanced test page to handle async module loading

### Technical Debt 📝
1. **Race Data Loading**: `race-helpers` and `tracking` tests fail because `state.races` is empty
   - **Solution**: Import `races.js` in test page or mock race data
   - **Priority**: Low (doesn't block refactoring progress)
