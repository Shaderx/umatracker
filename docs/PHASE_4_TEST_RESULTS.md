## 🔧 Bug Fix Applied During Testing

**Issue Found**: `planner-renderer.js` test failed with "state is not defined"  
**Cause**: `isSlotTracked()` in tracking.js was referencing `state` but it wasn't imported  
**Solution**: Added `import { state as globalState } from '../core/state.js';` at the top of tracking.js and updated references to use `globalState`

**Files Modified**:
- `js/features/tracking.js` (lines 6, 79-80)

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Not Phase 4 Related)

### 1. `race-helpers.js` - Timing Issue
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')`  
**Status**: Known issue from Phase 1

### 2. `tracking.js` - State Access Issue
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trackedFactorId')`  
**Status**: Known issue from Phase 1

### 3. `planner-renderer.js` - State Reference
**Error**: `state is not defined`  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added import statement

## 🎯 Test Coverage Analysis

### What Was Tested
1. **Module Loading**: Successfully loads all 24 hidden factors
2. **Data Structure**: Each factor has required fields (id, names, conditions, check function)
3. **Lookup Functions**: Can find factors by ID
4. **Filter Functions**: Can separate trackable from non-trackable factors
5. **Data Integrity**: Counts add up correctly (18 + 6 = 24)
6. **Function References**: Check functions are properly referenced (not strings)

### What Works
- ✅ All 24 factors load with complete metadata
- ✅ Bilingual support (EN/JP) for all factors
- ✅ Trackable factors have getRaces functions
- ✅ Non-trackable factors don't have getRaces functions
- ✅ Helper functions work correctly
- ✅ No linter errors
